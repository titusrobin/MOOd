This package is designed to facilitate working with the nuScenes dataset, providing tools to load and process data with ease. This README outlines how to download the nuScenes data, use the load_data.py script, and utilize the provided sample data in cone_samples.json.

Contents
nuscenes/: Folder to store nuScenes data files.
cone_samples.json: A saved subsample of the nuScenes data, specifically filtered for traffic cones. This file is generated by one of the functions in load_data.py.
load_data.py: Script for loading and processing nuScenes data.
toolkit_instructions.txt: Text file with additional instructions for using the toolkit.
Downloading the nuScenes Dataset
To use this toolkit, you need to download the nuScenes dataset:

Go to the nuScenes website.
Register for an account, if you haven’t already.
Download the appropriate dataset version for your project. This package is compatible with the trainval01_camera_blobs subset.
Extract the downloaded data and move it to the Data_Toolkit/nuscenes/ folder so that the structure matches this toolkit's requirements.
Using load_data.py
The load_data.py script is designed to load and preprocess the nuScenes dataset, making it easy to filter for specific objects or data types. Here’s how to use it:

Set Up: Make sure the nuScenes data is downloaded and placed in the nuscenes/ folder, as described above.
Run the Script: To execute load_data.py, open a terminal, navigate to the Data_Toolkit folder, and run:
bash
Copy code
python load_data.py
This will load the nuScenes data and process it based on the functions defined in the script.
cone_samples.json
The cone_samples.json file is a JSON-formatted file containing a subsample of the nuScenes data, specifically filtered for traffic cones. This subsample is generated by one of the functions in load_data.py, providing a smaller dataset for quick testing and development. It contains metadata and file paths for images that feature traffic cones, allowing for efficient testing without loading the entire dataset.
